    <p>Dementia is a progressive and debilitating neurological disorder that primarily affects cognitive functions, such
      as memory, reasoning, and communication. It is not a specific disease but rather a general term encompassing
      various conditions characterized by a decline in cognitive abilities. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form
      of dementia, accounting for a significant majority of cases. Other types include vascular dementia, Lewy body
      dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. The symptoms of dementia often start subtly and worsen over time,
      significantly impacting an individual's daily life and independence. As the condition progresses, individuals may
      struggle with tasks that were once routine, experience personality changes, and face challenges in maintaining
      social relationships. Dementia not only poses significant challenges for those directly affected but also places a
      considerable emotional and practical burden on their families and caregivers. While there is currently no cure for
      dementia, early diagnosis and appropriate care strategies can help manage symptoms and improve the quality of life
      for individuals living with this condition. Ongoing research is crucial in the quest to better understand, treat,
      and eventually prevent dementia. </p>
